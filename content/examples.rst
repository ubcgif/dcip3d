Examples
========

Version 5.5
-----------

Here, the program libraries for DCIP3D v5.5 will be used to:

    - create tensor models
    - DC and IP data for conductivity and chargeability models, respectively
    - invert DC and IP data to recover conductivity and chargeability models, respectively

Zip folders containing all necessary files can be downloaded here:

    - `Download and open the zip folder containing the entire DCIP3D example <https://github.com/ubcgif/dcip3d/raw/master/assets/dcipoctree_example.zip>`__

The full example is parsed into 5 sections:

    DC Forward modeling <example/dcfwd>
    IP Forward modeling <example/ipfwd>
    DC Inversion <example/dcinv>
    IP Inversion <example/ipinv>



Version 5.0 Legacy Example
--------------------------

We also have a legacy example that was created with DCIP3D v5.0. The results of this example can be reproduced with DCIP3D v5.5 but it will require some alteration of the input files.
